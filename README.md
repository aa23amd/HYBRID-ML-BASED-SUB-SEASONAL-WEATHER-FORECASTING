# HYBRID-ML-BASED-SUB-SEASONAL-WEATHER-FORECASTING
Overview
This repository documents the entire workflow from data acquisition to model deployment. The primary objective is to predict key meteorological variables—particularly the arithmetic mean of future temperature extremes—using a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of physics-based forecasting and data-driven machine learning methods. The work includes extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and experimentation with multiple regression models.

Dataset
The project uses a large-scale weather dataset provided on the Kaggle platform. Each record corresponds to a specific geographical location and start date for a two-week forecast period, including various meteorological and climate features. For more details about the dataset and variable descriptions, please refer to the Kaggle competition page.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing & EDA:
Rigorous cleaning and visualization were performed to identify missing values, trends, and seasonal patterns. Custom features were engineered to better capture the temporal dynamics of weather variables.

Modeling Approach:
Several regression models were explored, including tree-based ensembles (Random Forest, LightGBM) and gradient boosting techniques. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were employed to optimize performance and minimize prediction errors.

Hybrid Forecasting:
The project uniquely combines insights from physics-based weather models with machine learning predictions, improving the overall accuracy of sub‐seasonal forecasts.

Results
Experimental results indicate that the integrated approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, providing more stable and accurate forecasts. Detailed performance metrics and model comparisons are documented in the notebooks included in the repository.

How to Run
Clone the repository.
